# OneTeam iOS Demo

* Images and list data could be fetched from network or could be used from local.

* 'shouldUseLocalData' boolean parameter which is located in the ViewModel, could be used for getting the data from remote or local.

    - However for furher manipulations the code can be slightly changed.
    - For instance; getting the images from local and getting the list from the network.
   
* To explain some codes, I added "DEV_NOTES" as comments in the project.
